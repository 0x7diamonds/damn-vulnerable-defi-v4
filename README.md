Halmos vs Damn Vulnerable DeFi is the series of articles about solving the Damn Vulnerable DeFi CTF using the Halmos symbolic analyzer. 

Since theredguild have released Damn Vulnerable Defi v4, that is fully migrated to foundry-based testing, it is very comfortable to use Halmos to solve these challenges.
